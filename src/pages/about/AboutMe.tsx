            next project I worked on was an entity search engine (articles or

            Privately, I am constantly developing in front-end technologies and
            node.js. I also working on the development of my own application
            "BudgetApp" which uses the API of the National Bank of Poland and
            analyzes currency and gold prices in different periods of time
            through charts. This application also has options for analyzing the
            user's budget and provides information about current and overdue
            bills nad others things about user budget. Ultimately, the
            application will analyze the currency, gold and crypto markets and
            help you manage your budget and invest.
